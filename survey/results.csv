Fighting climate change requires everyone to take part and it starts small. The fight against climate change should begin at preventing more damage from happening. Eliminating all threats is a basis for fighting climate change, the planting of trees is fundamental in the fight of climate change, the greener the environment the more chance we have to fight climate change. Change of technology needs to be implemented, moving away from technology which burns and produce unhealthy toxins to the air to technology which will produce healthy toxins for example cars that use renewwble energy, solar. It is important to use tools that will not have negative impact in the later years, for example the use of solar energy is very important as it has no negative impact on the fight against climate change. Also the oceans play a vital role in climate change hence we need to take care of it and keep it clean and safe. The should also be amount of money paid to ensure that overuse and over production of toxins that are released in the air can be replaced and use the money to help eliminate all toxins also this will prevent people from producing those harmful toxins. Technology is a key factor in fighting climate change and essential that we use it in a way that it wont affect our fprodu. The overcrowding in cities should be eliminated as this is one of high factor causing climate change  cause there are too many productions in a city and too much cars producing carbon dioxide with little of trees;-;-;-;15;45;15;50;70;46;75;60;40
The reality that climate change is part of our daily talk and experiences has dawned. Whether switches on the Tv to watch the news or go on the internet to read a few news articles the reality of climate change can not be ignored. It is sad that we as human beings are the primary cause of this phenomenon and are the solution as well. Technology has brought about sustainable options on how to curb the adverse effects of climate change. Transportation is key in fighting climate change. I would invent an engine that rubs on water as we have noted that fossil fuels have adverse effects on our planet. This engine would use a resource that is abundantly available and is easily recyclable. Construction trends have shown as well that the industry contributes to CO2 emission sin the environment. I would would invent a cement and steel alternative which is purely plant based. This will ensure a renewable source of construction raw materials and would avoid unnecessary importation and transportation of materials as people can construct with locally available materials. Urban areas have become concrete jungles and hence a limit or a reverse of this phenomenon will be critical. I would introduce cities that function and as forests. Limit individual vehicular traffic. Mass public transportation running on the water engine would only serve these new cities. Clothing and furniture in this city will also be entirely made from plant based products. The use of all fossil fuels will be banned in this city.;-;-;-;1;5;13;80;55;66;80;80;55
As ideas to combat climate change, less individual transport (such as cars and motorcycles) could be used and more public transport (such as buses, trains, subways, trams) could be used. More trees, plants and autotrophic living beings could also be planted. It would also be important to clean forests (to reduce fires and thus gas releases), oceans (clean up plastics, microplastics, nanoparticles) and the biosphere in general (garbage on the streets, for example). In addition, we should reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using less transport or walking more, or by reducing industrialization. If possible, try to switch to an electric company with zero carbon or renewable energy policies. It is still an excellent idea to install solar panels or solar collectors. It is essential to turn off appliances and lights when not in use, and always choose more efficient ones with lower energy consumption. It would also be important to reduce the consumption of meat and milk. Livestock is responsible for a large part of greenhouse gas emissions. In this way, we can eat more plant-based meals, in addition to improving our health, we are improving the planet and our quality of life. It is also important to consume sustainable and locally sourced products (our place of residence or close by, in markets, for example). Many cosmetics, food and hygiene products have their raw materials extracted by processes that also emit toxic gases. Finally, it is important to make the people around us aware of the cause. Encourage friends, family and co-workers to reduce their carbon footprint.;-;-;-;40;45;31;80;95;56;90;87;60
Climate change has greatly  affected our World negatively in many ways. There is food insecurity due to climate changes which have negatively impacted on our agricultural production. Animal husbandry and animal diseases has affected beef, poultry and other animal farming. Our general health has also been affected due to toxics in the air. We therefore need to reduce dangerous green house gas emissions by embracing alternative  renewable energy. We can use Solar and wind energy and avoid Coal which is commonly used to power our Industries. We should also try to use natural manure in our farming instead of the dangerous chemicals that deplete our soils and poison it. Eventually rendering the soils poor and unproductive. We should also plant more trees and vegetation to prevent desertification and to purify our environment and keep it clean. This will bring more rainfall and thus improve our Agricultural production. We should also keep our Oceans, Seas and Rivers clean by stopping to dump Industrial waste and other harmful substances. This will keep our marine life safe and provide more food for us and also conducive environments. United Nations should come up with rules and Regulations that must be adhered to  by all Member nations in fighting climate changes. There should be strict penalties for any defaulting members and heavy embargoes. This might bring some sanity to our world which is facing danger of climate change.;-;-;-;25;25;25;70;70;65;80;82;43
How to fight climate change. 1. Go green. 2. Clean your environment 3. Stop littering 4. Use products that are not harmful to the earth 5. Dispose products (harmful) in a way that will not harm the earth 6. Reduce air pollution 7. Stop cutting trees down 9. Practice corporate social responsibility 10. use earth energy friendly machines 11. Educate people on ways to fight climate change 12. Create signboards, post on social media about the dangers of climate change 13. Recycle. 14. Protect endangered animals 15. Switch to green power 16. Avoiding meat and dairy products is one of the biggest ways to reduce your environmental impact on the planet 17. Cut back on flying: When flying is unavoidable, pay a little extra for carbon offsetting 18. Leave the car at home: Not only do cars contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, but air pollution caused by exhaust fumes from traffic poses a serious threat to public health 19. Cut consumption â€“ and waste 20. Spend your money responsibly: Find out if your money in used to fight climate change 21. Plant a tree: A single tree will absorb one ton of carbon dioxide over its lifetime. 22. Turn off electronic devices: Simply turning off your television, DVD player, stereo, and computer, when you're not using them, will save you thousands of pounds of carbon dioxide a year. 23: Check your tires: Keeping your tires inflated properly can improve your gas mileage by more than 3 percent. Every gallon of gasoline saved keeps 20 pounds of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. 24. Use less hot water: It takes a lot of energy to heat water. Use less hot water by taking shorter and cooler showers and washing your clothes in cold or warm instead of hot water (more than 500 pounds of carbon dioxide saved per year). 25. Avoid products with a lot of packaging: You can save 1,200 pounds of carbon dioxide if you reduce your garbage by 10 percent. 26. Adjust your thermostat: Moving your thermostat down just 2 degrees in winter and up 2 degrees in summer could save about 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year.;90;70;58;;;;70;70;53;90;92;36
Climate change has always been the center topic discussed among most people, especially youngsters nowadays because they are the ones who realize how dire the consequences will be if this problem is not addressed properly. First, fighting it comes from people themselves in the first place, the awareness of the problem and what it leads to is the key to any solution. People should know that everything they do has either a set back or can be an asset element in the fight. They should be educated about climate change and ways of fighting it which can start from schools. How would people know the alternative of many things they use? For example, they should be given all the information, like how to switch energy sources and to what, what carbon emissions actually cause, how to choose eco-friendly products more often and the easiest would be recycling. Second, we have to stop dealing with the problem in easiness, the situation should be discussed as it is, without using terms that makes it a normal or easy problem. We have to use terms that reflects what is actually happening and how catastrophic the consequences will be if we did not work all together against this.  It is not a high temperature season, it is not a normal summer, it is climate change and global warming that causes severe droughts and floods. Last but not least, the alternatives should be easily accessed with low prices, we can't expect from people to pay more for alternatives. The governments especially environment ministries should start paving the way  into a new era of eco-friendly lives, planting more trees, recommending better choices of consumption and of course not forgetting that laws and penalties are an ultimate solution in this fight when people fail to cooperate.;-;-;-;-;-;-;30;25;27;75;60;45
The best way to fight against something is to know what we're fighting against or for, therefore there's no better way to start a war against climate change than to learn what we can do against it. Starting to learn, for example, about carbom emissions is a good first step, because you're actively reading about a problem - which can lead you to some possible solutions, like using more public transportation or, if you need to drive your car, at least use it for more than just yourself. Even learning more about green power and switching to it, slowly. When it comes to saving the planet, it's all about being thoughtful of everything and everyone, never leaving your mark aside. What you do is just as important as what everybody else does and every single step and help counts. There's only one planet Earth, learn what you can do to save it. But don't just save all the knowledge to yourself - share it! With your friends and family, with the world! Helps others getting as inspired as you are to save your home planet! Inspire them to, for example, go to work by bike if they can! Or even change the way they eat slightly so they feed themselves better, healthier and in a more Earth conscious way! Show them local markets where they can buy organic vegetables and fruits instead of going to the same supermarkets. Be the change you want to see in the rest of the world and inspire that change to happen. Make the change happen, starting by yourself. See the world as it could be instead of simply what it is!;-;-;-;-;-;-;20;25;26;85;70;52
Our planet is at risk at reaching a no point of return if we do not aggressively stem the incidence of climate change within the coming decade. At this point everything is at stake and all hands should be on deck to working towards fighting climate change and perhaps even restoring the planetâ€™s equilibrium. Governments need to be on board and they need to take the lead by creating an enabling environment that include radical environmental legislation and policy changes that will force industry to comply. This could include taxes, fees and profit-linked fines being imposed for transgressors. There should be independent oversight of manufacturersâ€™ compliance processes. Governments can also control the amount of energy utilised through a variety of means. With an enabling environment being created by the State, the private sector can also play its part in the following ways: -        Exploration and adoption into the use of wind technology -        The exploration and adoption of renewable energy on a smaller scale for individual households such as using trash -        Solar energy -        Nuclear energy -        Harnessing of water resources to generate energy -        The promotion of energy conservation techniques for both industry and households. There is also need to invest heavily in the research and development of not only new sources of energy and energy conservation. Other techniques may include sustained reforestation efforts and the creation of green cities.  In all endeavours to combat climate change there also needs to be clear, concise and accurate communication to the public at large so that the international community at large is on the same page.;-;-;-;-;-;-;80;77;60;90;82;53
"By being caused by and affecting everyone, it becomes everyones responsibility to address climate change. It's very easy for the individual to dismiss the consequences of their actions as insignifcant in the light of big corporations, and vise versa in simply say 'we're supplying demand!' The resulting ideas to fight climate change touch on all societal levels. Firstly, the individual. The obvious choice, as has been realised for decades now, is promoting plant-based life styles. Primarily their diet, which is the most influencial, but also most other forms of animal products gained from high density farms, and land that's had it's biodiversity diminished entirely for grass-grazing. The alternative is dramatically reducing the amount of land used for crops to feed animals, and instead returning that land to wildlife-promoting wilderness. Then, of course, come the steps that are easier to accept for most people because they don't actually involve much personal change; flying less, taking public transport where availble, having less children, buying less. Overall, consume less, waste less. For corporations, naturally, since capitalistic mindsets have created this environment, and the determinetal effects won't be felt by corporations until it's too late to actually address, the only truly effective course of action is eye-wateringly high regulations on unsustainable business practices, and awe-inspiring, glowing promotion of sustainable practices. Naturally it's the roles of governments to facilitate the societal shift away from the consumer practices that maintain the climate-change-enabling conditions we're in now. Socialism and communism would be a sensible end goal. If everyone lives in a manner where appreciation of the environmental source of your goods is a fundamental idea to your life style, then who will conciously take steps to destroy that environmental source? Ultimately it's a matter of education. Educating people on the consequences of their actions and the source of those actions can help them, hopefully, make the base-line decision to act in both their own personal best interest, and in the interest of the global society we all invariably live in.";-;-;-;-;-;-;90;95;83;85;81;74
Humans are NOT multiplanetary species, there have been moves made to move the human race to planet Mars but unfortunately the absence of magnetic fields makes it impossible, at least for now. This then forces us to save the Earth for ourselves and future generations to come. It may seem like a task which may be taken at government level, but that's not entirely true, growing a tree at your home, fighting deforestation, commute using busses or bicycles, switching to greenpower are all means we can each contribute towards limiting our carbon emissions, in our respective households and society. The truth is though, as mere mortals, we can only do so much, a huge responsibility lies with our respective governments and global leaders, the existing carbon tax are clearly not enough as 7 continue to ravage our ozone layer, exposing us to harm radiations from the sun. Of course some of it is beyond human control, we can hardly do anything to stop the melting of Antarctica and rising sea level but therein lies the responsibility in all of us to our bit in order to save the human race.;-;-;-;-;-;-;30;40;40;75;70;62
Imagine a world where everything is in disarray and there is chaos everywhere. Today there is snow falling heavily, tomorrow the scorching sun rises with all intensity, and the next day we are terrorized by another change of weather. the world would not be a better place to live in. It is important for us to guard and protect the earth for future generations. this start with fighting climate change by taking care of our human activities. we must make sure that the gases that are emitted from our industries are as pure as possible and not harmful to the climate. we should reduce air pollution and water pollution as much as possible. This can be done by reducing our dependence on electricity and fossil fuels and using more clean gases like solar energy for lighting.  fighting climate change is everyone's responsibility. dropping just a piece of plastic on the ground causes climate change. we should ensure we preserve our natural resources like water, and trees and avoid cutting trees where necessary, and plant more trees. natural habitats must remain balanced always. we should normalize using recyclable materials every time. we must reduce our carbon emissions and use less packaging at all times.  instead of driving we can walk or bike more to reduce our emissions.  how if we can change our lightbulbs from fluorescent to LEDs. Consuming less meat and fewer dairy products will also go a long way in solving the climate change problems. We can also reduce food waste by eating what we need and eating leftovers than buying food and throwing it away.;-;-;-;-;-;-;20;35;30;80;80;47
The climate change seems to be one of the most important modern problems. There was already much done, but I think we are going in the wrong direction. Our solutions are not really stopping climate change, but rather only delay the consequences. In my opinion, we shouldn't leave this task to individual persons. Instead the governments and big companies should be first who do something. If we can make healthy things cheaper, then people will switch just easier and more natural, teaching them won't be even required and that's because majority of Earth's population is poor. As for actual ideas to fight climate changes, we must finally start using renewable power sources in big scale. Wind and sun are still generating less than we need. Also, maybe it's time to start trying less known ways like restoring oceans by providing them with necessary elements. Next thing, I would like to talk about is pollution. I think, we made already good progress in this case, but we must focus on reasons why pollution even happens. Instead of 'cleaning' the world, we should stop generating so much garbage, that is: plastic bottles etc. I don't think we can make everyone to follow the rules, so at least we should make breaking the rules less impactful for health for our planet. Last thing, I would like to add, is to watch what big organizations do. We must remember that huge companies like for example WHO, still need to make somehow money to exist and I think that can raise some questions. Do they really care about our health or they think about money first? All information should be available to public if they want us to trust them.;-;-;-;-;-;-;30;45;32;90;90;73
Climate change is a serious issue that is affecting every human's life but the irony is that, that change is caused by the very same humans that are being affected by it. I think there are many ways we can try to combat this issue. One of the many are: 1. Change the way electricity is being produced from coal and switch to renewable energy, this should be standard. The use of Solar Panels should be compulsory within households. 2. Switch to electric cars. This point connects to the 1st one in a sense that electric cars will reduce harm to the environment which will then make the environment more healthy and in that way the production of electricity will be sustainable. 3. Come up with laws that will incriminate anyone that damages the environment. For example, littering should be regarded as a crime in all countries. Basically, my whole point is that if we were to go the natural route, the Earth will be a better place. What's causing clime change is the production of all these man-made things in the name of 'making profit'.;-;-;-;-;-;-;15;20;17;75;75;62
One of the main contributions to climate change is pollution (via air, water and on proper earth). As it's common knowledge, meat production has a big effect on this, as worldwide governments should start thinking about different ways to reduce this impact on Earth. One that I've been thinking about for maybe a while is the viabilization of producing meat and animal's derivates throught renewable energies, such as the wind and the waves strength, in a system that could use biological resources and ways, like water and winds strength to push and improve the production. Per example, by using the winds, we could get factories to start their machines and engines, not using any electricity or carbon or any other subsidiary matter for this effect.;-;-;-;-;-;-;15;22;13;75;42;58
Use recycling to create employment with each residential area having groups to educate people about climate change and impact of recycling from each household. Each area should have a drop off zone that doesn't become a dumping site. It should be monitored and clearly labelled with which items can be deposited where. Ideally, do a weight sytem or some kind of system where people receive a voucher (to be used in a plastic free store) to purchase items using their own containers or reusing purchased containers to stock up with soap powder, dishwash soap, dishwash liquid, flour, cereals, liquid bath soap, shampoo, conditioner, bran, sugar, teabags, tea leaves, coffee, oats, cocoa, various sweets, crisps, etc. Also have environmentally friendly toothbrushes for sale, hairbrushes and combs made form recycling. Get large supermarkets on board too.  Each residential centre takes their filled recycling loads to a main centre. Follow through showing how all the products are recycled and used. Have a shop open for education and touring the venue and buying products. People who are homeless can be educated and shown to collect litter and take to the residential centres or main centre for a refund. They receive a voucher to use at a supermarket to buy food. Have packets available for everyone to use to store cardboard, plastic, tins, glass. Keep educating people on the benefits of recycling and the impact on climate change. Use this initiative to let 16 + Year old children to work at venues to gain work experience and giving back to the community. This can be paid or voluntary.;-;-;-;-;-;-;35;27;35;95;95;78
The biggest problem in global warming is the 1% of humanity that is the most rich one. Billioners polluts earth milion times more than avarage person. They fly their private jets all the time and produce a lot of carbon emission. We need to start making them guilty about it and conduct campaigh that will raise awarness about it. When it will be loud enough, they will have to start behave better about global warming. Not only their private jets are the problem - also the fact that they are buying too many cars and stuff - much more things than they need in their everyday life. Another serious problem in case of global warming is China. It is a country that dont care at all about earth. Their carbon emission is more than every country in Europe produce but one does anything about it. China does whatever they want. We need to remember that it is a country ruled by communist that create strict regime and every country seems to dont see problem in it. Zero actions have been taken by others coutnry goverments - there are blind about China stuff. If we really want to fight climate change, we need to do something about two things - 1 % of people and China. Goverments need to start pushing China into changing their politics about climat change. If everyone can cut Russia of everything, they can do the same about China and help really protect the Earth. Global warming have the same or maybe even more serious consequences than regular war.;-;-;-;-;-;-;10;45;47;30;50;43
"We are losing our battle to save the planet, and by a huge gap, even if we make everything we can now, we still have few chances to make a big change; this means we must move now and drastically; first of all cut our emissions, it doesn't matter the cost and the impact in our life, we are talking about saving the only planet we have and we may lose in the next century; stop gas-only vehicle completely, we should invest only on hybrid/electric vehicle, and do it now, not in some decades; stop any factory, activity, at any level which increase pollution and burns fossil fuels, increase renewable energy investments, we have to make the most from wind power which we exploit very little. Last but not least cut our personal investments, and improve our recycle activities, we must change our behaviour and stop thinking someone else will do it, they won't, and we have no time left.";-;-;-;-;-;-;30;30;30;90;92;62
Global warming is slowly becoming a  pandemic around the world, what I think needs to change is that stricter laws need to be put in place for businesses and households and the way in which businesses and households consume resources should be monitored and should they be found to not be adhering to these laws they should be severely penalized. The only way to to effectively make a change is to be stricter and harsher so that they donâ€™t fall back into that their old pattern. Systems need to be put in place if we want the world to remain the way it is, if not changing it for the better. Global warming needs the whole world to band together to work towards a better future, for not only our generation but future generations as well. If we fail to make these changes now, our future looks bleak.;-;-;-;-;-;-;10;5;61;50;25;33
The most ideal and effective method to preserve our planet in which humanity has thrived all these centuries is to foster everyone the idea of synergy and cooperation in order to achieve a common goal. Everyone should feel the urge to think about the course of the human species and act in a way that protects the environment and everything in it. This means they should feel as if their actions affect everyone not only around them but in a very distant location. For example they should feel the responsibility to protect the climate by not polluting or by being eco friendly for the purpose of maintaining human existence. People around the globe must develop a feeling of giving society and people around them a better quality of living. Also it is vital that they  start thinking more critically about the policies of big enterprises and industries which are the main reason of the climate change (because of the huge emission of carbon dioxide);-;-;-;-;-;-;5;2;7;80;70;53
Global warming is a term you must have heard by now as it is very prevalent in todayâ€™s world. Moreover, it has become a very dangerous environmental issue which we must resolve as soon as possible. If we do not prevent it now, soon we will find it hard to survive on this planet. There are many changes we can bring about in our life both big and small to prevent global warming and save our planet. Stop deforestation in all forms. Do not cut down more trees as it will only worsen the level of carbon dioxide in the air. Instead, encourage people to plant even more trees to create a fine balance in nature. We can prevent global warming by adopting a healthy lifestyle. Try to carpool with your relatives and friends to not produce carbon emissions. Do not cut down trees unnecessarily and replace old electronic gadgets. As a result of the burning of fossil fuels, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increase rapidly and contribute to global warming. Reduce the carbon footprint and do not travel through planes that often. Replace all bulbs with LED lights, helps in reducing the use of energy by a massive amount.;-;-;-;-;-;-;30;27;25;80;75;33
"To combat global warming, it is essential to replace our current methods of energy production. It is no longer possible to postpone or justify the indiscriminate production of CO2. However, this cannot be achieved through imposition; it is important that it comes from bottom-up. This can best be achieved through awareness-raising. In a highly globalised and capitalistic society such as ours, it is the consumers who make the difference. Convincing consumers of the importance of a green transition is therefore the way to achieve it as quickly as possible. Some ideas on how to achieve this are therefore related to pop culture: music, TV shows, catchy testimonials that can target different age groups in the population. It should not seem like an imposition from above, it should rather start as a fashion, and continue as the right way to be seen in society. We will win when the bicycle is seen as more attractive than the car, and the electric car more than the petrol-powered one. Just as cigarettes have been banned from movies, so clean energy must be pushed as much as possible in new ones. Attract by imitation, not by imposition--this is the way. It would also be useful to try to satisfy the fears of the most stubborn objectors. For example, a large part of the deniers is also xenophobic. It might be essential to point out how a continued rise in temperatures would lead to humanitarian crises, which would in turn increase the influx of immigrants. If even this were to fail, the only route would be that of legislative imposition. At that point, however, the environmental problems would be so obvious that they could no longer be ignored in any case.";-;-;-;-;-;-;25;52;20;90;87;87
renewable energy is fundamental to powering the world as we are moving away from fossil fuels. climate change has implicated on national, global levels including local. lets vote for a climate change activist, stand with comprehensive climate policies, and use our voices to legislators when you and I disagree. use LED lighting since they use 90% less energy than incandescent bulbs and half as much as compact fluorescent. recycling, acquire virgin resource from logging trees to mining minerals, exploits more resources than recycling existing materials. Add refuse to the three 'Rs' we already know, reduce, reuse, and recycle. choosing to buy less or not at all is the origin mantra for saving money, also when you do not buy, you cut down on the amount that you contribute to landfills. Use energy star appliances, these appliances save loads of energy over the conventional counterparts. Turning off or unplug devices you are not using, in addition have smart strips for devices that pull power when they are in standby mode, be sure to actively turn off or unplug those devices you are not using. Embracing natural ventilation and lighting, taking advantage of daylight and cool breezes is a delightful way to reduce energy use as the days get longer, temperatures get warmer. Adjusting your thermostat set point down by a few degrees in the winter and up by a few degrees in the summer can make significant impact on your overall home energy use. Do not forget to spread the word to friends and family encouraging them to reduce their carbon pollution, and encourage them to join global movements. Shop local and buy sustainable it reduces carbon footprint, you will be helping small businesses, your nearby farms, and reducing fossil fuels emission associated with transport and cold chain storage.;-;-;-;-;-;-;70;62;43;85;80;60
Climate change is a problem for all, hence we need to find ways to solve this issue. There are many ways to reduce climate change and the most important one is to reduce our carbon emissions which may be achieved by various things. Our population is growing rapidly and our energy needs will always be upon us, hence we need ways to meet the energy demands while also supplying clean energy. We can use renewable energy sources for example things like solar energy, synthetic gas, wind energy etc. We can use Hydrogen to fuel our electric cars. Hydrogen is the lightest element in the periodic table and it is the cleanest burning fuel. This means that the use of hydrogen in the car motors could our one of many solutions we can rely on. In order to shy away from carbon emitting vehicles we could rely more on public transport to reduce the total amount of carbon emissions. The more we use public transport, the higher the number of cars not being used hence more reduction in carbon emissions. This simply means that the fewer the number of people driving, the less emissions we can expect. Another factor to consider is using more renewable energy sources like your wind turbines which use wind power to generate energy and this is another alternative to reducing the amount of carbon emissions.  Using solar energy can also assist in reducing climate change as these uses the sun as the energy source which means that there is no carbon emissions being experienced in this case.;-;-;-;-;-;-;35;47;30;80;77;52
My solution is apparently very simple and consists in the use of clean nuclear energy, that is, deriving from new generation nuclear power plants. In part it may be possible to use nuclear fission, in part fusion. The two technologies are very different from each other: while the former have been in operation for decades, it is necessary to push a lot on research for fusion technologies. The high temperatures involved require very complex technologies, not yet fully realized. I believe that the Western world will be ready for this technological leap within a few decades and that with an extra effort we could arrive at a safe and economical solution in a few years. I believe that the richest states (USA, UK, De, France, Italy, Canada, Japan, S.Korea, Australia, etc ...) could lead this interesting technological race that would have gigantic benefits not only from an economic point of view. , but also environmental, strategic, military. I believe it is feasible, despite the tremendous pressure from the hydrocarbon lobbies;-;-;-;-;-;-;10;5;30;80;65;57

Every gallon of gasoline saved keeps 20 pounds of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. 24. Use less hot water: It takes a lot of energy to heat water. Use less hot water by taking shorter and cooler showers and washing your clothes in cold or warm instead of hot water (more than 500 pounds of carbon dioxide saved per year). 25. Avoid products with a lot of packaging: You can save 1,200 pounds of carbon dioxide if you reduce your garbage by 10 percent. 26. Adjust your thermostat: Moving your thermostat down just 2 degrees in winter and up 2 degrees in summer could save about 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year.;-;-;-;-;-;-;70;70;53;90;92;37
Climate change has been a problem that we've been faced with as the world. Climate change is defined as the change of the climate for example more glaciers are melting,it's getting hotter than before. The main way to fight climate change is to plant more trees so they can absorb all the carbon dioxide and gas emissions from the world. Using more environmentally friendly products that do not cause any harm to the environment such as recyclable materials such as bottles and glasses. We can implement cars that move with batteries and require to car them instead of cars that release carbon dioxide.  Instead of big firms using coal to manufacture electricity which in turn releases carbon dioxide they can look at an alternative of producing electricity via solar panels which emit less gasses to the atmosphere.  We can use a system of recycling of the products like classify where the glasses,papers and bottles should be recycled and offer incentives to citizens that invest well in recycling. We as the citizens as the this world can do better without the government intervening and try to minimize and  do things that are environmentally friendly and will not harm the environment.;-;-;-;30;35;40;-;-;-;85;77;55
Climate Change is a very complicated issue, because people don't believe to it or they are too lazy to actually do something. An idea would be to make recycling obligatory in countries where it isn't already, and pose a fair amount for fine to those who don't conform. Also, people do not recycle because they don't have a motivation to do so. Maybe a money incentive could work. It has to be an amount that won't be diregarded but also not too much money so people don't make it a profession or take advantage of others. Also, a lot of pressure has to be put to politicians, in order to implement more cautious measures and also force big polluting units (like factories) to adopt policies that are more eco friendly. Also, the use of fire should be taken in consideration, especially from junkyards and farms. People are used to burn a big amount of thrash or redundant weeds often, leading to more release of CO2, which affects the ozon layer. Finally, people need to be more careful about their wasting behavior. Beaches and natural sceneries all around the world are filled with thrash from tourists that disregard the rules. There has to be a stricter supervision, but also more organizations that clean beaches or the water. Those organizations must not be independent, but incorporated in the government, so their action can be more organized and efficient and also more funded. More creative ways can be achieved by using nudges, a technique that uses behavioral science to nudge people to certain behaviors.;-;-;-;1;5;3;-;-;-;85;85;72
Banning golf courses (waste of water), banning private planes, banning cruises, using water from treatment plants in agriculture and livestock, planting trees, create more gardens and natural parks, using more public transport in cities, prohibit cars in some zones, with some exceptions, banning swimming pools in homes, using irrigation in public spaces only at night, ending deforestation, eat less beef and pork and eat more vegetables (be more vegan and vegetarian), also eat less fish, use less single-use plastics, recycle more and reuse more materials, less consumerism, buy less clothes ( highly polluting industry). Limit the use of water in homes and factories, bet more on renewable energies, mainly solar energy in homes, bet on wave energy and solar energy, investigate and bet more on hydrogen. Reduce hydropower to store more water in dams. Create more electric car charging stations, create water desalination plants and nuclear power plants for energy production, due to the greater demand for energy. Bet on the thermal insulation of houses and buildings, invest in air conditioning, bet on more sustainable materials such as wood. I think these measures are good for the sustainability of the planet and that they look after the future of the next generations. It was also important to try to plant some vegetation in arid areas such as the Sahara desert or the Middle East, areas without trees that would benefit from these measures. Ending coal-fired plants is also necessary as it is highly polluting, and gradually reducing the use of natural gas. Bet more on electrical equipment and less on combustion engines.;-;-;-;70;35;55;-;-;-;90;87;75
One thing to fight climate change is eating less meat and diary products. It has a great impact on the planet and reduces your environmental influence as the carbon footprint of one cheesburger is equival to e.g. six times fish and chips. Another thing would be to leave your car at home and switch to public transportation or simple walks. Air pollution caused by exhaust fumes not only affects our planet, but also our health. Respecting and protecting green spaces is also very important. They provide multiple benefits, such as lowering air pollution, cooling overheated urban areas, and are important habitats for variety of animals. You can even start planting trees, either individually or as part of a collective. Shopping sustainable also helps our planet a lot. Supporting local businesses and buying seasonal foods reduce fossil fuel emissions and help to lower the usage of energy. You can even go a step further and grown your own vegetables. This also leads to another helpful tip is not to waste food. Avoid buying things you do not need or bulk-buying. Measure portions of your food before eating, be creative with leftovers or even make compost out of them. Shop and eat wisely! Not only this can save our planet but also save you some money. Remember, it is alway very important to start a climate conversation as well. Since people tend to trust friends and family the most, it is a good idea to pick up a conversation about climate change and how we can save our planet. It is always better to hear that from a peer than experts or scientist which we tend not to trust.;-;-;-;25;17;37;-;-;-;87;86;66
Our world is dying and a lot of people still don't get that there are various possibilities that can change it. I know a lot of people who blame huge comapnies of destroying the Earth and that they don't want to change their lifestyles just because they think they behaviour won't do much. I'm not saying that it's not a thing, but if everyone or at least some people would change they perspective it would really do a thing. Firstly we should think how what things we eat, by consuming less meat the CO2 pollution would be so much smaller, and also we can stop suffer of most of the animals. Secondly we should think twice before buying new thing: do we really need this? can we get this from second-hand? maybe we can ask our friends if they can share it with us? Another think is recycling and I am not only thinking about throwing things at a specific bin, but also about reusing stuff. Like maybe your jeans have a lot of stains, so maybe you should dye them, or that lamp that is not working anymore can be repaired or turned into some other ornament? All of it is not about making your life harder, but more sufficient and make you think about your decisions. When it comes to wider masses we can use a lot of different innovations that came to life in last years. Like drones- they can easily reach places we cannot and they can do stuff a single person would suffer to do in that amout of time they are doing. We could have drones that plant trees, that pick garbage, that controles weather there are no illigal garbege dump or illigal activites from comapanies, they can also check the about of air pollutions, if people are not smoking garbage in they hearths.;-;-;-;5;7;8;-;-;-;80;70;65
Climate change is firstly caused by mostly human beings due to their daily activities that end up being harmful onto the climate, examples of some of the activities that cause climate change are usage of cars ,chopping down of trees and burning of fossil fuels. Climate change can at times be harmful because it ends up giving unstable weather conditions such as an extremely hot temperature or even natural disasters, so the question is how do we fight climate change ? Climate change needs us as humans to change our ways of doing in order to bring the changes ,we can firstly start by decreasing usage of many cars daily ,Law can be created to say people should use buses or trains if in need of going wherever they want to go or even bicycle and only use cars for cases of emergency and that way we would have reduced a lot of traffic caused by cars everyday and it would be one step ahead of fighting climate change. The second one should be prohibiting people from chopping down forest trees just because they want to build something there ,many trees and removed for the purpose of building but at the same time the cutting down of trees causes climate change because we need trees in our daily lives as they provide us with oxygen.;-;-;-;25;30;10;-;-;-;85;45;38
Firstly we need to know what causes climate change. Climate change is caused by air pollutants from steam factories and environmental pollutants like waste and rubbish this causes the disruption on ecosystem thus resulting in irregular order of nature which is Climate change. To prevent this further from happening we need to implement dynamo technology to divert from coal in making electricity.  Implement Green energy and passive design in our structures to stop burning fossils. We use sun energy for solar and at night we use the energy stored from solar to use in that way no coal will be of use. We have to implement the idea of cleanliness and what cleanliness can do for us as far as nature is concerned to try and make the society clean to avoid the environmental waste to make sure that government implement structures to assist with keeping the waste away from environment. We can use the already used technologies like solar wind but make sure that we improve it by it being not only dependent on wind but to store energy for when there's isn't enough wind to run electricity.   The main idea is to use nature for energy without burning fossils.;-;-;-;10;7;8;-;-;-;80;77;72
To fight climate change we need to reevaluate our ideas towards mass creation of products and plantlife. Homogenisation through farming certain plants or animals in large swathes damages ecosystems irreparably. To counteract this, humans need to grow their own subsidence and return to smaller scale collectives that trade their own wares. We need to be rewarded for re-using items of technology rather than simply discarding them when they reach their sell-by date. The insistence of growth which makes the world a 'global village, needs to be replaced by returning our focus to growing our communities and feeding our ourselves, without necessarily becoming insular. We need laws in place that discourage our rapid consumption of products that need to be shipped around the world. It goes without saying, that our energy needs must be disinvested with fossil fuels, and replaced with renewable energies, such as solar, water and wind to generate the energy we require, but on the whole, we need to make our world smaller connective communities rather simply a global village.;-;-;-;80;60;60;-;-;-;87;86;78
The best way to fight climate change is to modify little by little the world we live in wich because we already have many things that harm our environment. We humans have a huge impact on this so we need to change our habits. Reduce the use of cars on cities would be a significant change. We should stop deflorestation too because trees help us. If we try to reduce the burning of fossil fuels, oils and gas it will help us a lot. Agriculture doesnt help either because many animals produce methane wich will affect our planet. Its used nitrous oxide for fertilizers and they are not good either. So if we want to change this, we need to start small and improve all of the above so we can reduce the harm we do to our planet. Some countrys already contribute to this and we should all follow their example;-;-;-;5;2;7;-;-;-;70;87;42
Urge the government to take bold, ambitious climate action now. Again the main objective would be to create posters asking for help to raise climate ambition by painting with climate art. Encouraging the usage of energy wisely and save money too.. Mobilise for local climate action. Green my commute by encouraging reduction of transport emissions like flying less or using public transit or car-share. Start s climate conversation as solving climate change requires teamwork and finding common ground. Consuming less means wasting less and enjoying life more as too much of the the stuff we use id toxic and we don't share efficiently. the aim should be to focus on life's simple pleasures, spending time with nature and making a difference in society by providing purpose and belonging. The aim is to be more gentler to the earth by composting, upcycling, fixing and repurposing. Taking the initiative to invest in renewables and divest from fossil fuels. Even if one cannot install solar panels they will still be able to be part of the clean-energy economy by investing. Eating for a climate stable planet would also have a profound effect on the environment, this would take place by buying organic, growing own food or eating meat-free meals. Another positive effect would be getting politically active by taking action to reduce our individual carbon footprints. Green transition investments must accelerate the decarbonization of all aspects of our economy. Green jobs and sustainable and inclusive growth. Green economy making societies and people more resilient through a transition that is fair to all and leaves no one behind. In the long term, higher temperatures entail risks of negative consequences for the environment, and so for human beings as well. Global warming could among other things cause extreme climatic events, more severe droughts, floods and rising sea levels.;-;-;-;35;27;37;-;-;-;90;90;73
Climate change is a globally relevant issue that has the potential to affect people in every corner of the world. In this essay, I'll propose 5 unique and actionable methods of fighting global warming and the resulting climate change that support social, economic and environmental sustainability: 1. Public transportation initiatives and tax concessions. By encouraging more people to use public transportation and bicycles, we can effectively keep more vehicles off the roads, lower CO2 emissions on a wide scale, and use tax concessions to incentivize more people to leave their vehicles at home. 2. Compostable packaging. Biodegradable packaging can have similar impacts and degradation time scales as plastic packaging. By using more compostable packaging, we can ensure that our packaging is truly eco-friendly and that our packaging materials align with our claims of sustainability. 3. Low carbon diet promotion. Diet can play a huge role in personal carbon footprint reduction. Initiatives that promote vegan and vegetarian options, locally sourced produce, and meat-free meals can have a significant impact, especially when people choose these options together, like 'Meat Free Mondays'. 4. Tree planting. Deforestation is a huge driver of climate change. Tree planting initiatives that focus on biodiversity, rewilding, and planting species native to the area can help to ensure that our forests and woodlands are available for generations to come. 5. Petition local governments. Governments and corporations hold the bulk of power in this world, and can enact far-reaching policies to reduce carbon emissions and promote more planet friendly methods of travel, dining, manufacturing, shipping and business operation.;-;-;-;70;62;68;-;-;-;92;92;81
My ideas to fight climate change include the following : -Changing our eating habits by avoiding meat and dairy products, this is one of the biggest ways to reduce our environmental impact on the planet. We should try to choose fresh, seasonal produce that is grown locally to help reduce the carbon emissions from transportation, preservation and prolonged refrigeration. - Avoiding flying as our main mode of transportation. Flying produces a lot of carbon emissions which are very harmful to the environment. Take a step back and think if you really need to fly out of town for that meeting rather than having it online. Maybe you can rethink that international trip you have and keep it local instead - Limit the usage of your motor vehicle. Instead of getting in the car, walk or cycle and enjoy the physical and mental health benefits, and the money saved. For longer journeys, use public transport, or try car sharing schemes.In this case , you are saving the world and saving your money as well. - Protect green spaces. Green spaces, such as parks and gardens, are important. They absorb carbon dioxide and are associated with lower levels of air pollution.They help to regulate temperature by cooling overheated urban areas, can reduce flood risk by absorbing surface rainwater and can provide important habitats for a wide variety of insects, animals, birds and amphibians.They also provide multiple benefits to public health, with studies linking green space to reduced levels of stress.;-;-;-;60;57;67;-;-;-;85;72;60
1. Eliminate Food Waste Food waste in the US occurs mostly in stores and at homeâ€”either because it spoils on the store shelf or before we can eat it.  We can combat food waste by shopping for what you need, eating leftovers, composting scraps, and donating excess to food banks. You 2. Eat Plant-Based Transitioning to a vegetarian diet can cut your carbon footprint in half, and going vegan, even lower. Even shifting from high to low meat consumption can shrink your footprint by a third, 3. Use Clean Energy  and Use LED Lighting Renewable energy is fundamental to powering the world as we move away from fossil fuels. . Ask your representatives to support this bill to make Clean Energy Victory Bonds a reality. Additionally, you can purchase renewable energy from installers such as Blue Pacific Solar and RGS Energy, as well as plug into renewable utilities which donâ€™t require you to install any new hardware in your home to get sun- and wind-power. 4. Participate in the Democratic Process Climate change has implications on local, national, and global levels. While the average person isnâ€™t responsible for governing a nation, we are responsible for deciding who does. Vote for a climate activist, support comprehensive climate policies, and use your citizen voice to contact legislators when you disagree. 5. Improve Insulation One of the most cost-effective and accessible tactics to combating the climate crisis is better insulation. Older homes can lose up to 35 percent of heat through their walls. Modern insulation reduces the energy needed to heat a home, therefore reducing emissions and saving you money. . 6. Rethink Transportation Overhauling the worldâ€™s transportation systems, both commercial and personal, would save as much CO2 as one billion acres of regenerative agriculture. 7. Recycle Acquiring virgin resourcesâ€”from logging trees to mining mineralsâ€”exploits more resources than recycling existing materials. For example, recycled aluminum products use 95 percent less energy than creating new ones. About 50 percent of recycled materials come from households;-;-;-;60;57;67;-;-;-;75;80;75
We have to start traveling in shared vehicles and using public transport, using green energies and switching to them. We have to plan our trips and combine them. Replace our vehicle with something similar to a bicycle, being natural and simply being with the earth. Climate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety, and jobs. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate shocks, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries. Switching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewable energy like solar or wind will reduce the emissions that drive climate change. Adapting to climate impacts protects people, households, businesses, livelihoods, infrastructure, and natural ecosystems. Because human-induced warming is superimposed on a naturally varying climate, the rise in temperature has not been and will not be uniform or smooth across the country or over time. The intensity, frequency, and duration of North Atlantic hurricanes, as well as the frequency of the strongest hurricanes (Category 4 and 5), have been noted since the early 1980s. The relative contributions of human and natural causes to these increases are still uncertain. The intensity of storms associated with hurricanes and rainfall rates are expected to increase as the climate continues to warm. Sea level rise poses widespread and continuing threats to the region's economy and environment. Extreme heat will affect health, energy, agriculture and more. The decrease in water availability will have economic and environmental impacts. Increased heat, drought and insect outbreaks, all related to climate change, have increased wildfires. Diminishing water supplies, reduced agricultural yields, health impacts in cities due to heat and flooding, and erosion in coastal areas are additional concerns.;-;-;-;15;12;10;-;-;-;70;77;52
Cut back on eating meat and diary, this is one of the biggest ways to reduce your environmental impact on the planet. This can also be beneficial to your health, so it is a win-win. Try to limit consumption and waste to limit your carbon footprint. Respect and protect green areas such as parks and gardens as they absorb carbon dioxide and help lower air pollution. Plant trees and create your own green space with pot plants added around your house, Reduce your energy bills and consumption to cut your carbon footprint by doing simple tasks like switching of lights that are not being used and replacing lightbulbs with energy efficient bulbs. Leave your car at home to limit your carbon footprint and as a bonus you will improve your health as well. Also try and limit your flying. If you travel a lot for work, try video conferencing instead. It will not just help with you carbon footprint, but also help with your budget. Lastly I think we should all use our voices to help spread awareness of all the ways anybody can help, no matter how young or old you are. We can inspire people through simply setting a good example and being the change we want to see in the world. Simple changes can make a big difference in the grand scheme of things. These are my best ideas to help do our part in saving out planet and making it more green and more viable for future generations.;-;-;-;10;10;8;-;-;-;80;70;42
We must not be indifferent to the future of all of us. What makes people's character is their consideration not only for other people but also for the environment. If we do not act now, we will live worse. Extreme weather fluctuations, the end of holidays, the end of joyful life as we know it now. You don't have to buy an electric car right away to help the world. Start by sorting your garbage, lowering the temperature in your house or apartment in the winter, conserve water. Think about the carbon footprint you are creating. You can help the planet in the kitchen, on holiday, in your car, in your home, with friends. Replacing a conventional halogen bulb costs virtually nothing and has a huge impact not only on the environment, but also on your wallet. Did you know that you can save up to $250 a year in your home? Urban transport? Oh yeah, it's cheaper, often faster and greener. The same amount of people that fits in 10 car can fit in just one vehicle. You can get help anywhere. Big change is not about big steps, but just the opposite. Small changes are the foundation for change. The basic idea is to cut back on activities that use whatever resources are on the planet. In the case of light bulbs, for example, it's all about light time. Try to keep this in mind, spread the tips to friends, family and acquaintances. Educate yourself. It's not just about the future, it's about the present. It's not just about yourself, it's about everyone, including your family, children, friends and our home, our planet. Act now.;-;-;-;5;5;5;-;-;-;80;85;60
Unfortunately, people only acknowledge questions such as the climate change when they are negatively impacted by these challenges. Therefore, some ideas that can reinforce change focus on the monetization of good measures - penalizing those that do not practice them and providing a monetary prize to those who do. Incentivising such behaviors can help improve the reduction of produced residues which will help the sustainability of the world. Furthermore, some more strict gas emissions policies are required to help reduce the impact on the stratosphere. Several things can be performed to reduce emissions and residue production - the recovery for energy production, their treatment and usage for other steps within the process they are resulting from are feasible examples. Many processes can integrate reused emissions and products after treatment, not only providing the reduction of waste but also reducing the payments involved in the process. Big companies have already established this type of system successfully, maybe it should become a common practice and be incentivised by monetized prizes. Furthermore, these solutions are mostly relatively simple to integrate within many common processes, resulting in the diminished environmental footprint of the enterprises that establish them. On another hand, some sensibility campaigns can be prepared to further implement this sustainable mentality in young children, developing their interest and enabling them with tools to help improving the world.;-;-;-;10;5;7;-;-;-;80;85;72
Climet change is an all around big issue that encapsulates many different but dangerous problems, but thankfully, because of that, we are able to apply many solutions to them. To start off, we could put in place or even mandate pollution limits on each country as to limit how much enterprises polute our enviroment. This would help greatly because enterprises are the biggest contributors to contamination. We could also build more green spaces and deemphasize going around cities on cars instead of public transport bringing many benefits appart from less polution, like a better public transport infraestructure and less air pollution all around. On top of that there should be studies into how we could recycle radioactive materials, because just burying them underground could result in accidents later on. Another way to help would be to create voluntary bodies where people can partake in cleaning their city, while at the same time teaching them how recicling is very important. Lastly we should analize how everything is truly recicled, because a part of what we recicle ends up in dumpster sites on other countries where they are not truly recicled and only lay there corroding the land. Those are by far not the only ways to  create a better enviroment for our descendants, but they are the ones I was able to think off that would be very beneficial and could be implemented without much difficulty in the most part. The most important part of this is comitting to the cause and not deeming it unnecesary when we are halfway through;-;-;-;10;10;17;-;-;-;65;75;62
fighting climate change seems impossible if you are just a regular citizen, the real fight needs to come from the big rich companies, if companies like amazon, shein, and their similars, started genuenly caring about the enviorment the changes would be easier. Avoiding waste, being careful of carbon emissions, being mindful of plastic packaging, caring about reusable objects and avoiding things that are to be thrown away after just one usage. the list could potentially be infite, colonialism and capitalism has made it to be this way, short terms usage, waste, compulsively buying new things, needing more than we actually do, we have been shaped this way, the economic circle has shaped us this way, it has made almost impossibe to live a sustainable life if you dont have enough money or time. the wealthy and rich have opporunities while the working class struggles. money could help repair the some of the damage done by colonialism, redistribuiting money and goods and taxing the rich could potentially help those in need, while doing this, the sustainability could increase. the inaccessibility of sustainability is the rich's fault. we need changes that come from the upper class and the rich business need to start acually caring about the enviorment other than greenwash their social media pages, they also need to start paynig their workers a living wage and giving them better conditions, so that they can manage a more sustainable life. furthermore, plastic. a material that has been useful but badly managed, some is indispensable, some is useless and harmful, reducing the useless ones some changses could be made. much packaging could be avoided and replaced with more sustainable one, we need to be able to recycle most of it to avoid pollution.;-;-;-;75;67;77;-;-;-;80;75;58
Every country should switch to renewable energy sources. You have to force the governments of all countries to do this. Poorer countries must be helped to achieve this goal. Meat production and consumption should be restricted. More forests and trees should be planted. Concrete in cities needs to be reduced. Do not mow the grass in cities and plant as many flower meadows as possible. This will help maintain a lower temperature in large cities.  People should start taking care of the environment themselves, stop buying plastic bottles. People should buy less clothing, those they do not use to sell or give to those who will find them useful.children from an early age should learn how to take care of the environment. Aware of the risks, the child becomes a responsible adult. The most important thing is the fight against the widespread concreteization of cities. Maintaining an adequate level of rivers and lakes. Not to dry out natural water bodies. It is necessary to reforest as many areas as possible that lie fallow. The most important thing is that the earth should be as green as possible. Then the climate will not warm up so quickly and there will not be so many natural disasters. I have no more ideas on how to help protect the environment. Everything remains in the hands of the people. They are the ones who have to start taking care of our plate. People have to look for ways to volunteer for the land themselves. This can be limiting garbage, limiting water consumption, planting flowers that wasps like the most, or planting trees;-;-;-;75;70;72;-;-;-;85;82;52
